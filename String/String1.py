# 1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string
# I messed up and put my stuff out of order and didnt really understand what i was doing so i'm starting again
m = "I messed up on my previous attempts time to try again"

# here we are saying that M is equal to the text, so when print(m) is used it actually means the text I put in.

print(m)
print(len(m))
