# 4. Write a Python function that takes a positive integer and
# returns the sum of the cube of all the positive integers smaller than the specified number

# Name the object, which will consist of an input integer.
num = int(input("Input a number here: "))
# Make sure to define sum as equal to 0.
sum1 = 0
# For every
for i in range(1, num):
    total = sum1 = + (i * i * i)
    print(total)
