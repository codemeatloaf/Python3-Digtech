# 3. Write a Python function to find the maximum and minimum numbers from a
# sequence of numbers.

# Define max_min is good for this, from research.
# This is putting in the list, so you input a number, and then it turns that into an integer.
a = input("Input your first number: ")
int(a)
b = input("Input your second number: ")
int(b)
c = input("input your third number: ")
int(c)
d = input("input your fourth and final number: ")
int(d)
# I never knew print(min(____)) or print(max(____))
print(min(a, b, c, d))
print(max(a, b, c, d))
